# AudioData
## Features
Converting String into Audio.
Hamming codes that supports 8 bits.
Converting string into 8 bit arrays.
Converting 8 bit arrays into a string.
Handshakes to determine where data starts. (is kinda crucial for doing it cross devides)

# TLDR
i'm unsure if this works with any radios or any other devices.
Haven't had the time to test it. 
But if someone wants to take a crack at it, go ahead!
